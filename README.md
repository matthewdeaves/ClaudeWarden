## Quick Start

### Diet Version Setup
```
Follow these core development principles for all work:

1. No Mock Implementations - Every function must be fully working from day one (test mocks OK)
2. Strict Architecture - Follow established patterns, don't bridge old/new systems  
3. Evidence-Based Progress - Provide working code/tests, use TodoWrite for 3+ step tasks
4. Checkpoint Communication - Ask "Ready to proceed?" before major steps
5. Quality First - Include error handling, test as you implement, no shortcuts
```
