# ClaudeWarden - AI Project Prompts

Ready-to-use prompting frameworks for Claude Code project development.

## Files

- **`guiding_principles.md`** - Core development principles and quality standards
- **`ways_of_working.md`** - Process management, todo tracking, and communication protocols  
- **`project_starter.md`** - Complete project specification framework with technology recommendations

## Usage

### Quick Start - Complete Framework Setup (Recommended)

**Copy and paste this into any Claude Code conversation:**

```
Please fetch and add all ClaudeWarden components to this project's CLAUDE.md file:

1. Development principles: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewdeaves/ClaudeWarden/main/guiding_principles.md
2. Process standards: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewdeaves/ClaudeWarden/main/ways_of_working.md  
3. Project starter: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewdeaves/ClaudeWarden/main/project_starter.md

After adding all three, use the project starter framework to help me build [your project description].
```

**That's it!** This gives Claude everything needed for consistent, high-quality project development.

### Individual Component Usage

**For New Projects:**
```
Use this project starter framework. I want to build [your project description]
```
*Then paste the project_starter.md content*

**For Development Standards:**
```
Follow these development principles for all work on this project.
```
*Then paste the guiding_principles.md content*

**For Process Management:**
```
Use these process standards for todo management and progress tracking.
```
*Then paste the ways_of_working.md content*

### Why Use All Three Components Together?

- **`guiding_principles.md`** - Ensures quality code and prevents common development pitfalls
- **`ways_of_working.md`** - Provides structured progress tracking and clear communication
- **`project_starter.md`** - Delivers comprehensive project planning and technology recommendations

Together, they create a complete framework for successful project development with Claude Code.
