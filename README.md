# AI Project Prompts

Ready-to-use prompting frameworks for Claude Code project development.

## Files

- **`guiding_principles.md`** - Core development principles to reference during implementation
- **`project_starter.md`** - Complete project specification framework with modern open-source technology recommendations, risk assessment, and phased implementation planning

## Usage

### Using the Project Starter

**Step 1:** Copy the project starter content from:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewdeaves/ClaudeWarden/refs/heads/main/project_starter.md
```

**Step 2:** Paste it into a new Claude Code conversation and say:
```
Use this project starter framework. I want to build [your project description]
```

**Alternative:** Ask Claude to fetch and embed it permanently:
```
Please fetch the project starter from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewdeaves/ClaudeWarden/refs/heads/main/project_starter.md

Add the full content to this project's CLAUDE.md file so you'll use this framework automatically.
```

### For the Guiding Principles

To ensure Claude follows these development principles in your project work, ask Claude to:

```
Please fetch the latest guiding principles from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewdeaves/ClaudeWarden/refs/heads/main/guiding_principles.md

Add the full content to this project's CLAUDE.md file (or update it if it already exists). 
These principles must be followed at all times during development work on this project.
```

This ensures Claude always has the latest principles loaded automatically in every session, rather than just a reference to fetch them.

### For Reference

You can also copy the relevant content from the files directly into your Claude Code conversations to improve project outcomes and prevent common development pitfalls.
