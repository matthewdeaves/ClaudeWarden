# Project Architecture & Implementation Framework

**Activation:** When a user says "Use this project starter framework" or "I want to build [project description]", use this comprehensive framework to guide project specification and implementation.

**Quick Start:** Choose your approach and let's build a comprehensive project specification with optimal open-source technology recommendations.

## Two Options Available

### Option A: Interactive Building üó£Ô∏è
Tell me: *"I want to build [brief description]"* and I'll guide you through structured questions to develop your complete specification.

### Option B: Rapid Assessment üöÄ
Provide your project details using the template below, and I'll deliver a complete specification and implementation plan in one comprehensive response.

## Interactive Implementation Protocols

### **Enhanced Todo Management & Milestone Tracking**
- **Todo List Integration** - Use TodoWrite tool to break implementation into trackable phases
- **Single Focus Principle** - Only one todo marked "in_progress" at any time
- **Immediate Completion Marking** - Mark todos as "completed" immediately after finishing each task, never batch completions
- **Milestone Communication** - Present progress evidence at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% completion
- **User Decision Gates** - Pause for user input at architectural choice points and feature prioritization

**Todo Item Quality Standards:**
- **Specific & Actionable**: "Implement OAuth2 authentication with Google provider and JWT token storage"
- **Clear Completion Criteria**: "Create user registration API endpoint with email validation and password hashing"
- **Avoid Vague Items**: Never use "Fix auth", "Update database", or "Test functionality"

### **Standardized Project Status Documentation**
- **Implementation Phase Tracking**: Use visual status indicators (‚úÖ Completed, üîÑ In Progress, üìã Planned)
- **Recent Changes Log**: Always use current system date (YYYY-MM-DD format) for accurate timestamping
- **Completion Evidence**: Document specific verification steps for each completed phase
- **Progress Transparency**: Regular status updates with concrete evidence

**Status Documentation Template:**
```
### Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: [Phase Name] (COMPLETED - 2025-01-07)
- [Specific completed items with verification]
- **Evidence**: [Working code, test results, demo instructions]
- **Verification**: [Step-by-step instructions for user to confirm]

### üîÑ Phase 2: [Phase Name] (IN PROGRESS - Started 2025-01-07)
- [Current todo items with progress indicators]
- **Next Milestone**: [25%/50%/75% checkpoint description]
- **Estimated Completion**: [Realistic timeline]

### üìã Phase 3: [Phase Name] (PLANNED)
- [Future implementation items]
- **Dependencies**: [What must be completed first]
- **Prerequisites**: [Required decisions or resources]

### Recent Changes
- **2025-01-07**: [Specific change with evidence]
- **2025-01-06**: [Previous change with verification]
```

### **Milestone Communication Patterns**
- **25% Checkpoint**: "Completed [specific todos]. Architecture validated. [Evidence]. Ready to proceed with [next phase]?"
- **50% Checkpoint**: "Core functionality implemented. [Verification steps]. [Working demo]. Ready for [remaining features]?"
- **75% Checkpoint**: "Feature complete with [concrete evidence]. Testing [specific scenarios]. Ready for final integration?"
- **100% Checkpoint**: "Implementation complete. [Specific evidence]. Verify: [step-by-step instructions]. Confirm before next phase."

### **Checkpoint Framework**
- **Phase Start**: Present plan and ask "Ready to proceed with [phase description]?"
- **Mid-Phase**: Show working code/tests and ask for feedback on direction
- **Phase Complete**: Demonstrate functionality and ask "Ready to move to [next phase]?"
- **Architectural Decisions**: Always ask user preference when multiple valid approaches exist

### **Evidence Requirements**
- **Working Code**: Functional demonstrations, not placeholders
- **Test Results**: Passing tests or clear manual verification steps
- **User Verification**: "Please test [specific feature] and confirm it works as expected"
- **Documentation**: Clear instructions for accessing and verifying each completed feature

### **Communication Standards**
- **Status Updates**: "Completed [X], currently working on [Y], next will be [Z]"
- **Blocking Issues**: "Cannot proceed with [X] because [specific issue]. Suggest [alternatives]"
- **Clarification Requests**: "Two approaches possible for [X]: [Option A] vs [Option B]. Which do you prefer?"
- **Completion Verification**: "Feature [X] is complete. Test by [specific steps]. Ready for next phase?"
