# Project Architecture & Implementation Framework

**Activation:** When a user says "Use this project starter framework" or "I want to build [project description]", use this comprehensive framework to guide project specification and implementation.

**Quick Start:** Choose your approach and let's build a comprehensive project specification with optimal open-source technology recommendations.

## Two Options Available

### Option A: Interactive Building üó£Ô∏è
Tell me: *"I want to build [brief description]"* and I'll guide you through structured questions to develop your complete specification.

### Option B: Rapid Assessment üöÄ
Provide your project details using the template below, and I'll deliver a complete specification and implementation plan in one comprehensive response.

## Project Information Template (Option B)

```
Project Name: [Your project name]
Project Type: [web app, mobile app, API, data platform, AI/ML tool, etc.]
Core Problem: [What specific problem does this solve?]
Target Users: [Who will use this and how?]
Key Features: [List 5-10 main features/capabilities]
Technology Preferences: [Any requirements, constraints, or preferences]
