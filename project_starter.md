# Project Architecture & Implementation Framework

**Activation:** When a user says "Use this project starter framework" or "I want to build [project description]", use this comprehensive framework to guide project specification and implementation.

**Quick Start:** Choose your approach and let's build a comprehensive project specification with optimal open-source technology recommendations.

## Two Options Available

### Option A: Interactive Building üó£Ô∏è
Tell me: *"I want to build [brief description]"* and I'll guide you through structured questions to develop your complete specification.

### Option B: Rapid Assessment üöÄ
Provide your project details using the template below, and I'll deliver a complete specification and implementation plan in one comprehensive response.

## Interactive Implementation Protocols

### **Phased Development Management**
- **Todo List Integration** - Use TodoWrite tool to break implementation into trackable phases
- **Single Focus Principle** - Only one todo marked "in_progress" at any time
- **Milestone Communication** - Present progress evidence at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% completion
- **User Decision Gates** - Pause for user input at architectural choice points and feature prioritization

### **Checkpoint Framework**
- **Phase Start**: Present plan and ask "Ready to proceed with [phase description]?"
- **Mid-Phase**: Show working code/tests and ask for feedback on direction
- **Phase Complete**: Demonstrate functionality and ask "Ready to move to [next phase]?"
- **Architectural Decisions**: Always ask user preference when multiple valid approaches exist

### **Evidence Requirements**
- **Working Code**: Functional demonstrations, not placeholders
- **Test Results**: Passing tests or clear manual verification steps
- **User Verification**: "Please test [specific feature] and confirm it works as expected"
- **Documentation**: Clear instructions for accessing and verifying each completed feature

### **Communication Standards**
- **Status Updates**: "Completed [X], currently working on [Y], next will be [Z]"
- **Blocking Issues**: "Cannot proceed with [X] because [specific issue]. Suggest [alternatives]"
- **Clarification Requests**: "Two approaches possible for [X]: [Option A] vs [Option B]. Which do you prefer?"
- **Completion Verification**: "Feature [X] is complete. Test by [specific steps]. Ready for next phase?"
