# Diet ClaudeWarden - Essential AI Development Standards

Ultra-lightweight framework for Claude Code (~300 tokens in CLAUDE.md).

## Quick Setup

**Copy and paste into any Claude Code conversation:**

```
Follow these core development principles for all work:

1. No Mock Implementations - Every function must be fully working from day one (test mocks OK)
2. Strict Architecture - Follow established patterns, don't bridge old/new systems  
3. Evidence-Based Progress - Provide working code/tests, use TodoWrite for 3+ step tasks
4. Checkpoint Communication - Ask "Ready to proceed?" before major steps
5. Quality First - Include error handling, test as you implement, no shortcuts

Use these checkpoint phrases:
- "Ready to proceed with [next phase]?"
- "Here's what works: [verification steps]" 
- "Verify by [specific instructions]"
```

## When to Use

- **Diet Version**: Simple tasks, limited Claude usage plans, quick implementations
- **Full Version**: Complex projects, unlimited plans, team environments

## Upgrade Path

When your project needs more structure, upgrade to [Full ClaudeWarden](../full/) for comprehensive project management, detailed process standards, and technology recommendations.
